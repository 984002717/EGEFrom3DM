This is a supporting repositories of our manuscript 'Study on exploring the extraction of geological elements from 3D geological models within the constraints of geological knowledge' submitted to Computers & Geosciences

The case study model is available at https://github.com/984002717/EGEFrom3DM/tree/main/Case_Study_Model/Case_Model. We used .obj file to test the proposed method. Detailed files see aforementioned link.

The Stratigraphic column is available at https://github.com/984002717/EGEFrom3DM/blob/main/stratigraphic_column.dat.
The 2D boundary of the 3D model is available at https://github.com/984002717/EGEFrom3DM/blob/main/stratigraphic_column.dat. Noteworthy, the Z value of the 2D boundary is the elevation of bottom plane of 3D model.

Put the “Bou.txt”, “stratigraphic_column.dat” and all .obj files into the path same with .py file, then Click the .py file will get the geological elements.
